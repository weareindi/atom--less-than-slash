# Atom: less-than-slash

My own build of the </ command as the original Atom `less-than-slash` package is now deprecated.

Usage:  
* Type `</` after a valid open tag to complete it quickly.

Things to note:  
* Progressively reads previous row after previous row from cursor position and back up the document until it finds a valid open html tag.
